name=PostGIS geoprocessing tools
description=A set of tools to do geoprocessing with PostGIS layers. The spatial SQL queries are run in the server where the layers come from, and the result will be a PostGIS layer (created directly in the server where the inputs come from) and not a shapefile as usually in the Processing toolbox. The plugin is experimental and in the future it will benefit from a number of improvements that will be made in the QGIS Processing toolbox.
